# WearToday
 An WearOS app to display the next lesson from Somtoday

This app isnt a finished thing(And probably wont)
Its a quick solution i made for my problem.

This probably wont work without making some custom adjustments based on the way your school configured it.
Some thing your gonna need to change are:
- refresh_token.txt
- VALID_TOKEN in both the python code and in the android app code
- get_next_lesson function in the python code
- Android app api endpoint
